This delay occurs due to the DNS cache, which is maintained by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and refers to the previous destination of your domains. For additional information on this topic, you may refer to the following article:\n\n▶ https://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/getting-started/dns-propagation\n\n\n\nIt is imperative to note that during the propagation period, it is advisable to refrain from making changes to the website without utilizing a local hosts file. Implementing changes during propagation, when it has not concluded, will result in modifications being reflected on the old server instead of the new one, as the DNS has not fully updated. This is why ensuring that propagation has been completed is crucial to avoid discrepancies in data or configurations during the transition. You may find guidance on how to use a local hosts file in the link below:\n\n▶ https://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/getting-started/local-hosts-file\n\n\n\n\nTo ascertain whether the DNS propagation has concluded and the changes are being directed to the new server, you can check the status through the following file:\n\n▶ \n\nIf you are able to see the file, that means that the propagation has concluded on your end as well, otherwise it means that the propagation is still occuring and you will need to wait a little bit more.'),(10,'1',':slowqueries','I have also observed some slow MySQL queries on your server, which may contribute to your current performance issues. To provide some context, a query is classified as \"slow\" when executing it takes over three seconds. I have identified several queries that significantly exceed this threshold.\n\n[PASTE SLOW QUERIES HERE]\n\nThese slow queries are placing considerable strain on your server resources in two primary ways:\n\n1. They are causing noticeable CPU spikes due to complex calculations and inefficient data processing. You can think of this situation as asking your server to solve a complicated puzzle; it requires substantial processing power, leaving fewer resources available for handling other tasks.\n\n2. These queries are consuming an unusually high amount of memory. When queries process large volumes of data without proper optimization, they can quickly exhaust your server\'s available memory, forcing it to rely on slower disk storage as a fallback.\n\nUpon analyzing your server logs, I found some particularly concerning query execution times, with the slowest query taking over 40 seconds to complete. For your reference, I have also saved a detailed report of all slow queries from the past week here: \n\n-> /home/myseatch/slow-queries-21-Sep-2023.txt.\n\nThe following tools can assist you in solving this issue to an extent:\n\n- Installing a server-side caching service such as Engintron, Redis, or Memcached\n- Set up a WordPress caching plugin if you are using WordPress; otherwise, implement a custom caching solution or use a caching addon for other CMSs if you are using ones such as Magento, OpenCart, and so on.\n- Implementing a CDN service like Cloudflare.\n\nI would happily provide more specific details about these solutions or assist with their implementation.\n\nAdditionally, I strongly recommend that a developer experienced in MySQL optimization review these slow queries, as they can help optimize the database queries for improved performance.'),(11,'1',':spamactivity','Hello,\n\nDuring our routine server monitoring, we identified a concerning volume of spam emails associated with your website, specifically under the domain:\n\n> lawofarizona.com\n\nThis domain is linked to your account with us:\n\n> FastCloud Essential - lawofarizona.com\n\nWhile investigating this issue, we noted that there is a potential vulnerability related to an unsecured contact form on your site, located at:\n\n> https://ges-uae.com/contact/\n\nIt appears that the absence of a captcha on this contact form may be contributing to the spam activity. Implementing a captcha can significantly enhance security by providing an additional verification step that effectively deters automated bots from misusing your contact forms. If it is not possible to add a reCAPTCHA, consider adding your domain to Cloudflare. By doing so, you can effectively prevent bot traffic at more global level. \n\nFor detailed instructions, please refer to the following link:  \n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/cloudflare\n\nCloudflare is a prominent web infrastructure and security company that provides a variety of services aimed at enhancing website performance and protection. One of its key functionalities is the ability to combat bots and spam, particularly those generated through contact forms.\n\nBy acting as an intermediary between users and websites, Cloudflare employs advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and filter out malicious traffic. For instance, when a user submits a contact form, Cloudflare analyzes the behavior of the request. If it detects patterns typical of bots, such as an unusually high submission rate or suspicious IP addresses, it can block or challenge the request, effectively reducing spam.\n\nMoreover, Cloudflare\'s security features, such as its Web Application Firewall (WAF), provide an additional layer of protection. This firewall helps to safeguard websites by monitoring incoming traffic and applying rules that prevent known threats from reaching the server. Therefore, website owners can enjoy peace of mind, knowing that their contact forms are less likely to be inundated with unwanted submissions.\n\nIn conclusion, Cloudflare serves as a vital tool for managing online security, particularly in the fight against bot-generated spam. By leveraging its sophisticated technology, it not only enhances website performance but also protects valuable communication channels from malicious interference.\n\nMoreover, we discovered that your WordPress application is currently configured to send emails using the PHP mail function, which lacks authentication and is susceptible to exploitation. To mitigate this risk, I strongly recommend configuring your WordPress application to use SMTP for email delivery, as it requires authentication and provides greater security. Again, you can utilize a plugin for this purpose, such as:\n\n> https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\n\nFor your SMTP configuration, please use the following mail server settings:\n\n- Username: email address that you would like to use\n- Password: password for the email address\n- Outgoing Server: sg1.fcomet.com\n- Hostname: sg1.fcomet.com\n- SMTP Port: 465 Secure\n\nYou can create the desired email address for sending emails through the Email Accounts tool in your cPanel account.\n\nWhile our spam filter does quarantine messages it identifies as spam, it is essential to note that no technology is infallible. Consequently, some spam emails may still bypass our filter, potentially impacting the reputation of the IP addresses used to send emails. This can lead to delays in email delivery and, in some cases, result in blocking. Therefore, we have implemented additional monitoring measures and are reaching out to provide you with further guidance on maintaining a good reputation for the IP addresses associated with our spam filter, as well as enhancing your email deliverability.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, we have temporarily changed the password for your email account and restricted outgoing email sending capabilities until the issue is resolved. Additionally, we have placed a restriction on the following website, \"fabigroup.com,\" to prevent further spam activity. \n\nPlease review this ticket at your earliest convenience and inform us once a captcha has been implemented on your website. This will allow us to monitor for any further spam activity effectively.\n\nTo facilitate your access, kindly visit the following website and share your IP address with us:\n\n> https://whatismyipaddress.com/\n\nThis will enable you to regain access to your website and address the ongoing issue. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.'),(12,'1',':serveroptimise','I would like to update you that the server was unreachable, so I had to reboot it to regain access.\n\nSince I had to reboot it, most of the logs are truncated, and I cannot confirm what caused the issue.\n\nHowever, to assist you, I have taken the liberty of further optimizing the system. Specifically, I have fine-tuned various system parameters to enhance performance, stability, and efficiency, particularly concerning network handling, process limits, and memory management.\n\nWe have installed and configured EngineTron accordingly.\n\nEngineTron is a tool designed to integrate Nginx with cPanel/WHM servers. It aims to enhance these servers\' performance and web serving capacity by utilizing Nginx as a reverse caching proxy for static files and adding a micro-cache layer for dynamic content. This setup helps reduce CPU and RAM load, improving overall server efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, I have optimized your Apache configuration.\n\nFurthermore, I have optimized your websites by installing Redis on the server and connecting them to it.\n\nRedis is an open-source, in-memory data store renowned for its exceptional speed and versatility. It primarily functions as a database, cache, and message broker, offering sub-millisecond latency for reading and writing data. Redis supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. It also includes features like replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence. Redis can be used to cache web pages, thereby reducing server load.\n\nMoreover, I have optimized your MySQL engine to ensure you can fully utilize the available resources. The LSAPI module has been enabled as a PHP handler, significantly enhancing PHP performance.\n\nWe have also increased the swap size to prevent the kernel from killing processes due to out-of-memory errors.\n\nFurthermore, please be aware that we have implemented an anti-bad-bot system designed to protect your websites from malicious bots. This system effectively safeguards against various types of harmful bots, including:\n\n- Scrapers that extract content without permission\n- Spambots that flood your site with unwanted messages\n- DDoS bots that attempt to overwhelm your server with traffic\n- Credential stuffing bots that try to gain unauthorized access\n- Vulnerability scanners that search for security weaknesses\n\nBy utilizing this anti-bad-bot system, we aim to enhance the security and performance of your websites, ensuring a safer online experience for you and your visitors. Some examples include:\n\n- masscan\n- 80legs\n\nBad reffererrs such as:\n\nzx6.ru\n100dollars-seo.com\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe have also made adjustments to the WHM settings. WHM, as a comprehensive control panel, offers a wide range of features; however, not all users require every option. Consequently, this can lead to unnecessary resource consumption, as the server allocates CPU and RAM to processes that may rarely, or even never, be utilized. \n\nFor instance, tools such as Awstats, Spamd, and Mailman are resource-intensive yet often go unused. To enhance your WHM experience and ensure that the server operates efficiently, we have disabled these features. This optimization helps to minimize CPU and RAM usage for processes that are not essential.\n\nPlease inform us if you require any of these tools, and we will promptly reactivate them on the server.\n\nThe server has been fully optimized to enhance performance. However, it is equally important to focus on your websites. I recommend collaborating with your developers to ensure they optimize the websites. This includes eliminating unnecessary processes and minimizing CPU and RAM usage to improve efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, please ensure that all your websites are propagated through a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN is a distributed server network that delivers web content to users based on their geographic location. A CDN reduces latency, enhances load times, and improves the overall user experience by caching content closer to the end users. A CDN can also help mitigate traffic spikes and provide additional security features, such as DDoS protection.\n\nIn the below article, you can read how to add your domains to Cloudflare:\n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/kb/how-to-add-a-domain-to-cloudflare\n\nThe following domains are currently NOT added to a CDN:\n\n[LIST OF DOMAINS HERE]\n\nPlease make sure to add them so they can take advantage of the features that the Cloudflare network can provide to them.'),(13,'1',':progress','Thank you for contacting the FastComet Technical Support Team.\n\nI kindly request additional time to thoroughly address your inquiry.\n\nRest assured, you will receive an update through this ticket as soon as further information becomes available.\n\nI deeply appreciate your time and patience in advance and thank you for your understanding.\n\nIn case there is anything else we can assist you with, please do not hesitate in contacting us.\n\nWe remain at your immediate disposal 24/7!'),(14,'1',':seen2','as evidenced by the graphic below:'),(15,'1',':req','As requested, I have now'),(16,'1',':seen1','as displayed in the picture below:'),(17,'1',':emergency','We have been alerted to an issue affecting the physical host on which your server \'node6450.myfcloud.com\' resides.

Doing so will diminish the overall website size and curtail loading times. Additionally, resizing images before uploading ensures that the website would not need to execute this task, thereby enhancing the speed with which images load. After local optimization, re-uploading the images to the server will enhance website performance.\n\n\n\n\n❷ Enhancing JavaScript Code and Minimizing DOM Elements: It would be beneficial to optimize the JavaScript code, diminish the Document Object Model (DOM) elements, and minify both JavaScript and CSS code on your website. Consequently, the website content will be fully loaded before any back-end script requests are made, thereby augmenting overall website performance. While numerous plugins can assist with these tasks, it is crucial to recognize that additional plugins can also augment the website\'s payload, which may adversely affect its performance. Therefore, consulting with a certified developer, who possesses the requisite tools and knowledge to scrutinize your website\'s code and assist you in optimizing it, would be the most prudent course of action to further enhance website speed.\n\n\n\n\n❸ Enabling a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Implementing a CDN allows website visitors to access your website from the CDN server that is geographically closest to them.

It could be indicative of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that is consuming your bandwidth. Based on the evidence provided in the screenshot below, it appears that the bandwidth consumption is being generated from multiple IPs, rather than a single source:\n\n-> https://prnt.sc/bU0qM6NiVjyL\n\nUnfortunately, there is no immediate solution to block this type of attack, however, you can mitigate its impact by using Cloudflare. Please refer to the information below for more information:\n\n\n\n\nFirst I would like to note why there are quotas on the shared hosting environment. As you can imagine - the shared plan is based on a server that you utilize as well as share the said server\'s resources with many other people who are hosted on it. The server\'s resources have a certain capacity, thus you are set to use a particular quota of resources at your leisure as long as you do not exceed them. Exceeding the resources will essentially put the server\'s load at a high and the reason that\'s bad is that one server\'s malfunction will affect all people that are on it. You will not only be putting yourself at risk of service downtime but others too. This is why we highly suggest that our Clients monitor their resource usage and optimize it accordingly so that the automatic Observer system does not suspend their account.\n\n\n\n\nBandwidth consumption can be optimized through various techniques and approaches, some of which are listed below:\n\n\n\nOptimizing website code and content can have a significant impact on the amount of bandwidth consumed by a website. Some ways to optimize website code and content include:\n\n\n\nOptimize images: Images can often be the largest files on a website and can significantly impact the website\'s bandwidth consumption. To optimize images, you can reduce their size, reduce the quality or resolution, and compress them. This can be done using image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, or by using online image compression tools like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n-> https://compressjpeg.com/\n\n\n\n\nCompress text files: Text files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, can be compressed to reduce their file size and reduce bandwidth consumption. Compression can be done with modification. For example, you can use the third-party tools below:\n\n\n\n\n-> https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier\n\n-> https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier\n\n-> https://codebeautify.org/minify-html\n\n\n\n\nUse efficient coding practices: Using efficient coding practices can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the internet, which can reduce bandwidth consumption. This includes minimizing the use of external resources, reducing the number of HTTP requests, and optimizing code for faster load times. This however is something that you would need to discuss with a developer.\n\n\n\n\nUse lazy loading: Lazy loading is a technique where images and other resources are loaded only when they are needed. This can help reduce the initial load time of a website and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the internet. I can see that your website is using WordPress, for example, you can use this plugin -> https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/ to lazy load your images or just use some caching plugin, for example, LiteSpeed cache which provides lazy load as well.\n\n\n\n\nUse responsive design: Responsive design is a technique where the layout and content of a website adjust to the size of the screen it is viewed on. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the internet, as the website is optimized for different devices. For example, there is the CSS option for srcset which sets different sizes of the images depending on the size of the monitor they are viewed in. \n\n\n\nUsing a content delivery network (CDN) can be an effective way to reduce bandwidth consumption and improve website performance. Here are some ways a CDN can help:\n\n\n\nReduced latency: A CDN works by caching website content on servers located in various geographical locations. When a user requests content from the website, the CDN server closest to the user delivers the content. This reduces the distance the content has to travel, which reduces latency and improves website performance.\n\n\n\n\nLower server load: When a website is accessed by a large number of users, the server can become overloaded, leading to slow load times and even downtime. By using a CDN, you can reduce the load on the server by offloading some of the content delivery to the CDN servers.\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above lead to decreased bandwidth consumption, by serving content from servers located closer to the user, a CDN can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the internet. This can significantly reduce bandwidth consumption. One of the CDNs that we recommend is Cloudflare. More information on Cloudflare and how to implement it in your setup, you can find in the article below:\n\n\n\n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/cloudflare\n\n\n\n\nCloudflare is a company that offers a variety of services. These services include content delivery network (CDN) and cybersecurity services. Cloudflare\'s CDN service uses a global network of servers to cache website content and deliver it to users from the closest server location, which can improve website performance and reduce bandwidth consumption.

I/O stands for \"input/output\" and refers to the speed of data transfer between the hard disk and the RAM on your hosting account. When we say your website has been exceeding the I/O limit, it means that your site is performing more read and write operations than the current hosting plan allows.\nThis type of issue often affects sites that need to handle a lot of data, such as those streaming media or dealing with many database records. It\'s important to note that exceeding your I/O limit doesn\'t usually generate errors. Instead, you might notice your site \"hanging\" or loading slowly while it waits for data to transfer.\n\nThere are several reasons why you might be experiencing high I/O usage. It could be due to transferring large files, frequent database operations, a high volume of concurrent users, or code that\'s performing excessive read/write operations.\nWe set these limitations on our Shared hosting solutions to ensure fair usage and prevent one user from affecting the performance of others on the same server. Unfortunately, this means we can\'t simply increase the limits on demand.\nWe use a couple of tools to monitor resource usage. The Observer tool tracks things like inodes, disk usage, and script executions, while the Resource Usage tool in cPanel monitors CPU, memory, and Entry Processes over time. Based on what we\'re seeing from these tools, it looks like your website\'s resource needs have outgrown what our Shared Hosting environment can provide.\nSo, what can we do about this? I have a couple of suggestions:\n\nConsider working with a website developer to optimize your site. This could involve improving database queries, minimizing unnecessary file operations, implementing caching strategies, and optimizing images. While we can\'t make these changes ourselves (as they require in-depth knowledge of your specific application), a developer could help implement these optimizations.\nAnother option is to upgrade your hosting plan. You might want to look into our FastCloud Extra plan, or even consider moving to a VPS or Dedicated Server. These options provide more resources and can better handle high-demand applications. You can check out our different hosting options at:\n\nhttps://www.fastcomet.com/pricing\nhttps://www.fastcomet.com/vps-pricing\nhttps://www.fastcomet.com/dedicated-servers-pricing\n\nI know this is a lot of information to take in, so please don\'t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. We\'re here to help you find the best solution for your website\'s performance.'),(87,'1',':suspend','Hello,\n\nDuring our server monitoring, we have noticed that your hosting account:\n\n> FastCloud Essential - burnwomanburn.com\n\nhas been exceeding the usage quotas, as illustrated here:\n\n> https://app.screencast.com/Wfvs71zA3iA2f\n\nThe screenshot has been taken from the Resource Usage tool in your cPanel account. You can review a graph representation of the resource usage below:\n\n> https://app.screencast.com/rWqsB2e4TdRK4\n\nAllow me to outline the resource limits that might have been exceeded:\n\n> I/O usage resources limit was reached for your site - The I/O is short for \"input/output.\" In the context of a hosting account, it\'s the speed of data transfer between the hard disk and the RAM. Generally speaking, sites that need to read and write a lot of data, such as those streaming any kind of media or with many database records are the ones that are hitting the limits of this resource more often. Please, note that exceeding your I/O limit does not usually generate errors. Instead, a site just \"hangs\" while it waits for the data to transfer from the hard disk to the RAM.\n\n> Physical memory resources limit was reached for your site - Exceeding the allocated RAM limit can lead to performance issues, slow response times, and even server instability. Causes of high memory usage may include memory leaks, inefficient code, large database queries, or excessive simultaneous connections.\n\n> CPU resources limit was reached for your site - The CPU is responsible for executing instructions and processing data on the server. When your website uses excessive CPU resources, it can slow down the server and affect the performance of other websites hosted on the same server. Common reasons for high CPU usage include inefficient code, poorly optimized scripts, or resource-intensive plugins or processes.\n\n> Entry processes limit - Note that there is a limit on the shared hosting environment on the entry processes that can run simultaneously on your account. It is set to 30 and this configuration is global for all our customers on the same server. It is in place to make sure that the resources on the server are divided properly between our customers on the same server. Note the entry processes are everything that runs on your account, such as a request to your website, a query to your database, a cron job running on your account, an email message, etc. The entry processes that can run simultaneously on your account are set to 40. Note that if there is a 41st process that needs to run, it will have to wait until there is an available slot for it. If there is no slot for a certain period, this will result in a Resource Limit Reached error message. You can check the resource usage for your account via cPanel > Resource usage.\n\n> Processes number limit - This limit, set to 80, applies universally to all customers sharing the same server. It ensures equitable resource distribution among all users.\n\nThese limitations are set by default to all of our Shared hosting solutions for a reason and that is to prevent one user from allocating all the available resources and cause performance issues for all the other users residing on the same server, which is something that we simply could not afford. Meaning that we will be unable to simply increase the limits on demand.\n\nI would like to elaborate on the differences between the Observer tool and the cPanel > Resource Usage tool where we got the information about the exceeded resources. The Observer monitoring tool is essentially a core resource allocation widget that can be used to track inodes, disk usage, script executions, and bandwidth, while the Resource Usage tool in cPanel allows you to monitor the consumption of CPU, memory (RAM), and Entry Processes (EP) over time. By regularly checking resource usage metrics, you can identify any abnormal spikes or trends that may indicate issues with your website or applications.\n\nBased on the resource usage patterns observed, it appears that your website has outgrown the capabilities of our FastCloud Extra hosting plan. To ensure optimal performance, stability, and reliability for your website visitors, I would recommend upgrading to a more robust hosting solution that can better accommodate your resource requirements. You may review the options below:\n\n>https://www.fastcomet.com/cloud-vps-hosting\n>https://www.fastcomet.com/dedicated-server-hosting\n\nAlternatively, please review the resource-intensive applications with the help of an experienced website developer who can optimize your websites and reduce the resource usage on your account.\n\nFinally, I would like to note that we were forced to temporarily restrict your account, as the same affects the entire server and the rest of the users on it.\n\nOnce you are ready to address this, please provide us with your IPv4 Address, seen here:\n\n> https://whatismyipaddress.com/'),(90,'1',':fixednot','I would like to provide you with an update regarding your account, which continues to significantly exceed the server resources, as illustrated in the graphic below:\n\n-> https://imgur.com/r6U2jll\n\nGiven that the current optimizations are not yielding the desired results, I recommend considering an immediate upgrade to the FastCloud Extra package:\n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/pricing\n\nThere are several notable differences between your current plan and the FastCloud Extra package.

You can initiate the upgrade directly from your Client Area, as demonstrated in the graphics below:\n\n-> https://imgur.com/rjwkHFJ  \n-> https://imgur.com/5JEVfjK  \n\nIf upgrading is not a feasible option for you, I suggest consulting with a web developer who can further optimize your applications to function effectively within the Plus account. However, based on the resource usage quotas that are currently being exceeded, it is evident that your applications have outgrown the capabilities of your existing hosting plan.\n\nIf 48 hours is insufficient for you to address this case, please do not hesitate to reach out. We can work together to arrange an extension that meets the needs of both parties involved. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are committed to finding a suitable solution.\n\nI am also providing your with access logs towards your website for the last 48 hours:\n\n6570 krsna.org\n203 krsna.tube\n27 de.krsna.org\n9 bhagavatdharmasamaj.org\n\nI have observed that none of the domains are currently proxied through Cloudflare. I strongly recommend activating Cloudflare as soon as possible. This service can significantly assist in mitigating issues similar to those you are experiencing, while also helping to alleviate CPU usage on the server. By utilizing Cloudflare\'s features, such as caching and DDoS protection, you can enhance your website\'s performance and security as well as elevate the Resource usage that your websites are causing.\n\nSince the plan you are currently using does not support Object caching, I recommend considering the following option if an upgrade to FastCloud Extra is not feasible:\n\n-> https://cloud.fastcomet.com/marketplace/cloudapps/139\n\nThis option will enable us to configure a dedicated Redis server for you, allowing us to install an object caching plugin for your websites.\n\nTo elaborate, Redis is an in-memory data structure store that is commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. It enhances the performance of web applications by storing frequently accessed data in memory, which significantly reduces the time required to retrieve that data compared to traditional database queries.\n\nIn the context of WordPress, implementing object caching with Redis can greatly improve performance. By caching objects such as database query results, WordPress can serve content more quickly, thereby reducing CPU load and memory usage. This is particularly beneficial for high-traffic websites, as it minimizes the number of database queries needed to generate pages. Consequently, this can lead to faster load times and a more responsive user experience, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of your site.'),(92,'1',':internaloptimise','Hello,\n\nThank you for getting back to me.\n\nI have unsuspended your account to enable global access.\n\nTo address this issue, I have implemented the following optimizations:\n\n1. I have disabled the default WordPress cron job and replaced it with a manual cron job that will execute every hour.\n2. I have deactivated the default admin-ajax functionality and integrated a custom admin-ajax implementation using a must-use plugin on your site. This new setup will disable the Heartbeat API entirely. Completely disabling the Heartbeat API can significantly reduce server load.\n3. I have deactivated the UpDraft plugin on your website due to its high resource consumption, which is not necessary in our shared hosting environment. It is important to note that you already have a remote backup solution in place with the JetBackup tool. This tool can provide you with up to seven copies of your entire account, ensuring that your data remains secure and easily recoverable.\n4. I have installed Redis locally so you can take advantage of object caching, while it is not as friendly and as good as using it on the server-level it can still provide some benefits.\n\nThese optimizations are designed to enhance your website\'s performance significantly. By replacing the default cron job with a manual one, we reduce the frequency of resource-intensive tasks, thereby lowering CPU usage. The custom admin-ajax implementation is more efficient, as it limits the number of requests made to the server, which can alleviate memory usage and improve overall functionality. Additionally, implementing browser caching rules allows static resources to be stored on users\' devices, reducing the load on your account and speeding up page load times.\n\nIt is important to note that these are the only optimizations we can perform on our end. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. However, if resource usage remains high, it may be necessary for you to consult with a web developer for further assistance or consider upgrading to at least the FastCloud Extra plan to accommodate your needs more effectively.\n\nThere are several significant differences between your current plan and the FastCloud Extra Package. The same would provide you with significantly more resources than your current package as follows:\n\n> 4 GB RAM\n> 4 CPU Cores\n> 40 Entry processes and 80 nPRoc\n> 2GB per Mailbox size limit\n> 1GB per database size limit\n> 400 Emails sent per hour\n> Inodes 500,000 soft limit 501,000 hard limit\n> 1024MB database size\n> 92160 MB bandwidth\n\nYou can review the full comparison between your current plan and the FastCloud Extra Package in the link below:\n\n> https://www.fastcomet.com/compare-shared-package\n\nAdditionally, the new plan offers several technologies that are not available on the other shared hosting plans to boost your site performance:\n\n> LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS)\n> PHP7/8 with APC & OPcache\n> 3x fewer users per server and 3x more CPU and RAM\n\nFurthermore, the plan includes 30 daily backups instead of the standard 7 backups included with the current package.\n\nBasically, on the new hosting plan you can improve your site speed and handle more visitors as well as improve your ranking with a better response time.\n\nMoreover, please enable Cloudflare on your domain. \n\nCloudflare is a powerful content delivery network (CDN) that enhances website performance and security. By acting as an intermediary between your server and visitors, Cloudflare caches your website\'s static content across its global network of servers. This caching reduces the load on your origin server, thereby optimizing resource consumption and improving page load times for users regardless of their geographical location.\n\nIn addition to its CDN capabilities, Cloudflare provides robust security features, including DDoS protection and a web application firewall (WAF). These features help safeguard your website from malicious attacks and unauthorized access, ensuring a more secure browsing experience for your visitors. By enabling Cloudflare, you not only enhance the speed and reliability of your website but also bolster its defenses against potential threats.\n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/kb/how-to-add-a-domain-to-cloudflare\n\nIf upgrading to FastCloud Extra is not a viable option for you, we recommend considering the following service that offers Redis object caching:\n\n-> https://cloud.fastcomet.com/marketplace/cloudapps/139\n\nObject caching in Redis is a powerful mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in memory, thereby reducing the need to repeatedly query the database. This approach significantly enhances the performance of WordPress and other websites by minimizing resource utilization. \n\nBy leveraging Redis, your website can retrieve data more quickly, as it bypasses the slower disk-based storage systems. This results in faster page load times and improved user experience. Additionally, Redis object caching can alleviate the load on your database server, allowing it to handle more requests simultaneously without compromising performance. \n\nPlease note that if the resource usage continues we will need to suspend your account again and you will need to either upgrade or hire a developer who would be able to optimize your projects further.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance.

It is installed by attackers on root-level compromised hosts by either replacing SSH-related binaries (ssh, sshd, ssh-add, etc.) or modifying a shared library used by SSH (libkeyutils). This rootkit\'s main purpose is to steal SSH login details for incoming and outgoing connections. The harvested credentials are sent to dropzone servers controlled by the attackers using specially crafted DNS-like packets. Additionally, SSH private keys stored on the compromised system for use with outgoing SSH connections are stolen as well. In addition to this the rootkit leaves a backdoor on infected servers which allows attackers to get remote shell access even if passwords are changed regularly. This is a serious type of exploit as the attackers have full root-level access to the infected server and can alter or remove any data present. For example, they can access sensitive data such as credit card details and personal information details of a webshop hosted on an infected server. Additionally, the server can be used for criminal activities such as sending spam, redirecting visitors to malicious websites.\n\nDue to the nature of the compromise, the only solution, in this case, is to set up a new server and migrate your data to it. All login credentials used with SSH connections from or to an infected machine as well as private SSH keys stored on the host must be considered compromised. Please note that your system probably has been infected with the rootkit for many weeks or even months. As a result of this infection, we would not be able to provide you with support for requests that require us to log into the server. The reason is that the system can no longer be trusted and accessing it can lead to the infection of our own devices and in return that can spread the infection to other systems which we cannot allow. We are still able to provide you with support for questions that you may have related to the service but until the rootkit infection is cleared we would not be able to assist you troubleshooting that requires access to the server as mentioned.\n\nIt is not possible to directly upgrade the operating system of your server. We can fully replicate the configuration of your CentOS 7 server on a new AlmaLinux 9 server which includes the latest kernel and software stack such as MySQL 8, the newest PHP versions, etc.\n\nAlmaLinux 9 is a fork of CentOS 8 that is developed by CloudLinux and it will be fully supported until 2032. Since AlmaLinux 9 is basically a successor and complete replacement of CentOS 8, it provides newer versions of system libraries and it provides significantly better security and performance as well. You can learn more on the matter here:\n\n> https://www.fastcomet.com/blog/almalinux-9-now-available-at-fastcomet\n\nThe upgrade process is more of a migration than an upgrade and the entire process goes like so:\n\n1) We set up a new server using AlmaLinux 9 in the same datacenter as your current one.\n2) Migrate the accounts to the newly-setup server.\n3) Provide you with details to test the websites\' functionality to be certain they are working properly.\n4) Swap the IP addresses and hostnames of the old and new server.\n5) Shut down the old server after 24 hours and then terminate it in another 24 hours after that.\n\nThe migration of all accounts on the server, the cPanel license, and the services installed on your server are included in the upgrade process.\n\nIn this regard, I would like to mention that there is a significant difference between your current server and the new operating system that we can set:\n\nCentOS 7 - PHP versions from 5.6 to 8.2 and MySQL 5.7\nAlmaLinux 9 - PHP versions from 7.2 to 8.2 and MySQL 8.0\n\nThere are differences between MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8 and some websites may not be working properly when using the new MySQL version. You can learn more about MySQL 8 here:\n\n> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/\n\nYou should also ensure that all of your applications would be able to work under at least PHP version 7.2.\n\nPlease, note that we are hosting oriented company and as such we do not specialize in development services, meaning that we will be unable to verify if your websites will be compatible with the new environment, nor we will be able to fix any issues related to their comparability with the up to date environment, which we are offering. Thus, prior to proceeding with the upgrade, we would strongly advise you to review your websites with the assistance of a certified developer, so he/she could verify if your websites will be compatible with the new environment and if that is not the case to bring them up to date with the current standards.\n\nAdditionally, before we can proceed with the setup of a new server and migrate your data to it the malware has to be removed, otherwise, it would be migrated to the new server which we cannot allow. These malicious files can negatively impact the performance of your websites by spawning malicious processes that would consume additional resources on your Hosting Account.\n\nFurthermore, a malware infection on your website can result in the stealing of the personal information of your users, such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc. It will also often modify the core files of your application which may break the functionality of your websites would make them completely inaccessible.\n\nWe have performed a malware scan on the server and the same found 4 malicious files on the server:\n\n/home/yorkracecourseco/subdomains/kiosk/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php\n/home/yorkracecourseco/subdomains/qr-api/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php\n/home/dashclientco/public_html/tmp/analog/ahtest.dashclient.co.uk/cache\n/home/dashclientco/public_html/tmp/analog/central.dashclient.co.uk/cache\n\nLet me note that clearing the malicious codes from the files falls out of our expertise as it requires development knowledge, thus it is best suited to be handled with the assistance of a certified developer or security specialist/service, such as:\n\n> https://sucuri.net/\n\nAlternatively, you can consider the Imunify360 feature that comes with automatic malware removal and would help you to clean up the malware. The service in question is the full paid version of ImunifyAV and can automatically remove malicious code and files from the server, in addition to a variety of other security features that make it harder for a website to be compromised again, as well as the automatic killing of any malicious processes on the server.\n\nWe use the Imunify360 service on all of our shared web hosting servers and are quite satisfied with the results. The service in question is a licensed one with a monthly subscription, and its license is based on the number of cPanel accounts available on the server.\n\nImunify360 can be obtained from the Client Area -> Products > My Products > Upgrade/Downgrade > Imunify360 license.\n\n--------------\n\nOnce you review your website and ensure they would be able to work under the new environment and that no malicious files are present on the server, please let us know and we will gladly move forward with the upgrade/migration process. Keep in mind that, during the upgrade/migration process, we recommend that you avoid making any changes on your websites and cPanel, as these changes will not be transferred over. You can even consider placing your websites under \"Maintenance Mode\" during the process. Of course, the migration could be scheduled for a convenient time for you.\n\nIf any questions/concerns occur, please do not hesitate to reach us back anytime.\n\nWe will be looking forward to your reply!'),(94,'1',':novalma','I have reviewed your server and I can see that you are using a Legacy OS, which is no longer supported.

This will migrate all of the data completely, including files, databases, email accounts and messages, SSL certificates, etc.\n3) Provide you with details to test the websites\' functionality to be certain they are working properly. \n4) Swap the IP addresses of the old and new server. This way the traffic to your website/s will be automatically routed to the new AlmaLiunux 9 server and you will not have to make any DNS changes for your domain names.\n5) Shut down the old server after 24 hours and then terminate it in another 24 hours after the upgrade process is completed.\n \nIt is important to check if your websites support MySQL 8.0 and PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3, as those will be available on the AlmaLinux 9 server. I have reviewed the current versions your are using on your Legacy OS server and I can confirm that:\n \nYou are currently utilizing an outdated PHP version (7.4) across all of your websites, as well as an outdated MySQL engine (5.7.44). It is essential to test your websites thoroughly and engage in discussions with your developers. They will need to configure the websites to ensure compatibility with the newer MySQL version (8) and at least PHP version (8.1). This upgrade is crucial for maintaining optimal performance, security, and access to the latest features.\n \nPlease consider the information above and update us when we can initiate the upgrade process for you. We will then gladly proceed further with that. Additionally, please make sure that you do not make any changes on your websites during the process, as they might not be saved on the new server.\n \nWe will be looking forward to your reply.'),(111,'2',':hello','Hello, thank you for reaching out!'),(112,'2','hello','You are most welcome'),(113,'1',':serverrestore','We are contacting you regarding the restoration of your d234.fcomet.com server.

EngineTron is a specialized tool that integrates Nginx with cPanel/WHM servers. Its primary objective is to enhance these servers\' performance and web serving capacity by utilizing Nginx as a reverse caching proxy for static files while also adding a micro-cache layer for dynamic content. This configuration significantly reduces CPU and RAM load, thereby improving overall server efficiency.\n\nIn addition, we can install Redis on your server and connect your websites to it. If you are using WordPress, we will handle the complete configuration for you. For other platforms, we can install Redis; however, you will need to configure it according to your specific requirements.\n\nRedis is an open-source, in-memory data store that is renowned for its exceptional speed and versatility. It primarily serves as a database, cache, and message broker, offering sub-millisecond latency for reading and writing data.\n\nMoreover, we can optimize your MySQL engine to ensure that you fully utilize the available resources. One key optimisation involves disabling remote connections to the MySQL server, protecting it from unauthorized access. By implementing this measure, we enhance the security of your database while maximizing performance.  \n\nEnabling the LSAPI module as a PHP handler can significantly enhance PHP performance, resulting in faster execution times for your applications as well.\n\nTo further improve system stability, we can increase the swap size, which will help prevent the kernel from terminating processes due to out-of-memory errors.\n\nAdditionally, we can implement an anti-bad-bot system specifically designed to protect your websites from malicious bots. This includes scrapers, spambots, DDoS bots, credential stuffing bots, and vulnerability scanners, all of which pose risks to your online presence.\n\nWe can also optimize your WHM settings. Since not all users require every available option, we can disable resource-intensive features such as Awstats, Spamd, and Mailman to minimize CPU and RAM usage. Please inform us if you require any of these tools, and we will ensure they remain active.\n\nWe can also enable CSF, which stands for ConfigServer Security & Firewall. CSF is a popular security tool designed to enhance server security by providing a robust firewall and login/intrusion detection system. It helps protect your server from various threats, including unauthorized access and DDoS attacks, by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic. \n\nAdditionally, CSF offers features such as process tracking, resource usage monitoring, and configuring alerts for suspicious activities. Implementing CSF can significantly improve your server\'s security posture and ensure a safer hosting environment.\n\nWe can also change the Multi-Processing Module (MPM) from \"worker\" to \"event\" on your server. The event MPM is designed to handle high levels of concurrent connections more efficiently than the worker MPM. \n\nWhile the worker MPM creates a separate thread for each connection, which can lead to increased memory usage under heavy loads, the event MPM utilizes a more streamlined approach. It allows for a single thread to manage multiple connections by keeping idle connections in a sleep state. This reduces resource consumption and improves performance, particularly for applications requiring numerous simultaneous requests, such as web servers serving static content or handling long-lived connections. \n\nBy switching to the event MPM, you may experience enhanced scalability and responsiveness, especially during peak traffic periods. \n\nPlease let us know if you would like to proceed with these changes or require further information.'),(118,'1',':check','Hello,\n\nDuring my investigation, I observed that your account has exceeded its resource usage limits, as illustrated in the graphic below:\n\n-> \n\nThe screenshot was captured using the Resource Usage tool in your cPanel account.\n\nI would like to outline the specific resource limits that may have been exceeded:\n\n> I/O Usage Limit: Your site has reached its I/O usage resources limit. I/O, which stands for \"input/output,\" refers to the speed of data transfer between the hard disk and the RAM. Typically, websites that require extensive reading and writing of data, such as those streaming media or managing large databases, are more likely to hit the limits of this resource. It is important to note that exceeding your I/O limit does not usually generate errors; instead, the site may \"hang\" while waiting for data to transfer from the hard disk to the RAM.\n\n> Physical Memory Limit: Your site has also reached its physical memory resources limit. Exceeding the allocated RAM limit can lead to performance issues, slow response times, and even server instability. High memory usage may result from factors such as memory leaks, inefficient code, large database queries, or excessive simultaneous connections.\n\n> CPU Resources Limit: Your site has reached its CPU resources limit. The CPU is responsible for executing instructions and processing data on the server. Excessive CPU usage by your website can slow down the server and negatively impact the performance of other websites hosted on the same server. Common causes of high CPU usage include inefficient code, poorly optimized scripts, or resource-intensive plugins and processes.\n\n> Entry Processes Limit: Please be aware that there is a limit on the number of entry processes that can run simultaneously on your account within the shared hosting environment. This limit is set to 30 and is a global configuration for all customers on the same server. It is designed to ensure that server resources are allocated fairly among all users. Entry processes encompass all activities on your account, such as website requests, database queries, cron jobs, and email messages. If an additional process attempts to run while the limit is reached, it will have to wait for an available slot. If no slot is available for an extended period, this will result in a Resource Limit Reached error message. You can monitor your account\'s resource usage via cPanel > Resource Usage.\n\n> Processes Number Limit: This limit, set to 80, applies universally to all customers sharing the same server. It ensures equitable resource distribution among all users.\n\nThese limitations are established by default for all our Shared hosting solutions to prevent any single user from monopolizing available resources, which could lead to performance issues for others on the same server. Consequently, we are unable to increase these limits on demand.\n\nI would like to clarify the differences between the Observer tool and the cPanel > Resource Usage tool, from which we obtained the information regarding the exceeded resources. The Observer monitoring tool serves as a core resource allocation widget that tracks inodes, disk usage, script executions, and bandwidth. In contrast, the Resource Usage tool in cPanel allows you to monitor CPU, memory (RAM), and Entry Processes (EP) consumption over time. By regularly checking these resource usage metrics, you can identify any abnormal spikes or trends that may indicate issues with your website or applications.\n\nTo optimize your website\'s performance and mitigate the load caused by your projects on the server, we can implement several optimization strategies on our end.\n\nI have checked your application and noted that some of them are WordPress, while we cannot assist you in optimizing custom applications, we can do so for those that are based on the WordPress system.\n\nFor instance, we can disable the default WordPress cron job and replace it with a manual cron job that executes at a specific time. This adjustment would reduce the frequency of cron job executions, thereby alleviating some of the load on your account.\n\nAdditionally, we can deactivate the default admin-ajax functionality and integrate a custom admin-ajax implementation using a must-use plugin. This change would disable the Heartbeat API entirely, which could significantly reduce server load.\n\nGiven that you already have JetBackup providing up to [HOW MUCH] copies of your entire account, we can also deactivate the UpDraft plugin due to its high resource consumption.\n\n-> [IS THERE A BACKUP PLUGIN IN THE HOSTING ACCOUNT?]\n\nMoreover, since you are utilizing the shared hosting Extra package, we can install LiteSpeed Cache and connect it to a Memcached instance on the server. \n\nLiteSpeed Cache is a powerful caching solution that enhances website performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the time it takes to retrieve this data. Object caching, particularly with Memcached, allows for the storage of complex data structures in memory, which can significantly speed up database queries and improve overall site responsiveness.\n\nThese optimizations are designed to enhance your website\'s performance significantly. However, if resource usage remains high, I recommend consulting with a web developer or considering an upgrade to the FastCloud Extra plan.\n\nThe FastCloud Extra Package offers several advantages over your current plan, including:\n\n- 4 GB RAM\n- 4 CPU Cores\n- 40 Entry Processes and 80 nPRoc\n- 2 GB per mailbox size limit\n- 1 GB per database size limit\n- 400 emails sent per hour\n- 500,000 inodes soft limit, 501,000 hard limit\n- 1024 MB database size\n- 92160 MB bandwidth\n\nI wish to ask also if you have considered enabling Cloudflare on your domain. It is a powerful CDN that could enhance your website\'s performance and security by:\n\n- Caching static content across its global network\n- Providing DDoS protection\n- Including a web application firewall (WAF) \n\nMore about it and how you can connect your domain to it you can find here:\n\n-> https://www.fastcomet.com/kb/how-to-add-a-domain-to-cloudflare\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like assistance with these optimizations, please do not hesitate to reach out.'),(119,'1',':root','While root-level access is supported on Dedicated CPU servers, please note that your current plan includes our managed services.
